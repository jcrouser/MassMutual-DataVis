## Making a map with points in R with leaflet
We're going to be doing a lot of the stuff from the RStudio [leaflet tutorial](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/). This walkthrough is a variation of [Amelia McNamara](https://github.com/AmeliaMN)'s version.

Load `leaflet` first:
```{r}
library(leaflet)
```

Let's start with a simple map
```{r}
m <- leaflet() %>%
  setView(-72.518978, 42.381050, zoom = 1) %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Load the default OpenStreetMap tile set (images that make up the map)
  addMarkers(lng=-72.518978, lat=42.381050, popup="DSDP!")

m
```

Note that the syntax here is similar to that of `ggplot2`. Please consult the [Leaflet documentation](http://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) for more details.

## Okay, let's do something with actual data

Lets look at [storm data](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/ftp.jsp) from the NOAA. It comes in a few files that we need to join together in order to use. For convenience, I've put them on the workshop website. You can download them manually, or you can use the `getURL()` function from `RCurl` to grab them from the web as I do below (they're big, so it takes a sec):

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(RCurl)

# One file contains information about the storm
stormdetails <- getURL("https://jcrouser.github.io/MassMutual-DataVis/datasets/StormEvents_details-ftp_v1.0_d2016_c20160810.csv")
stormdetails <- read_csv(stormdetails)

# The other contains actual location data
stormlocs <- getURL("https://jcrouser.github.io/MassMutual-DataVis/datasets/StormEvents_locations-ftp_v1.0_d2016_c20160810.csv")
stormlocs <- read_csv(stormlocs)

# We'll want to use them together, so we'll use a join
storms <- stormlocs %>%
  left_join(stormdetails, by="EVENT_ID")
```
```{r}
glimpse(storms)
```
Don't worry if you don't really understand the syntax above. Next week, [Ben Baumer](https://github.com/beanumber) will teach you all about SQL and joins.

## Mapping lightning strikes
Let's pull out the lightning strikes and map them as part of a `dplyr` chain
```{r}
lightning_map <- storms %>%               # Start with the storm data
  filter(EVENT_TYPE == "Lightning") %>%   # Filter down to just the lightning events
  leaflet() %>%                           # Pipe into a leaflet map
    addMarkers(~LONGITUDE, ~LATITUDE, popup = "Zap!") %>%   # Add markers at each LONGITUDE/LATITUDE pair
    addProviderTiles("Stamen.Toner")        # We'll use black/white tiles for dramatic effect

lightning_map
```

## Challenge: 
- Find another storm type to map
- Bonus-- add popups!

## One approach

```{r}
mtw_map <- storms %>%
  filter(EVENT_TYPE == "Marine Thunderstorm Wind") %>%
  leaflet() %>%
    addProviderTiles("Stamen.Toner") %>% 
    addMarkers(~LONGITUDE, ~LATITUDE, popup = ~EVENT_NARRATIVE)

mtw_map
```


## Polygons

First let's grab some data (and do a little conversion)

```{r}
tornados <- storms %>%
  filter(EVENT_TYPE=="Tornado") %>%
  mutate(DAMAGE_PROPERTY = as.numeric(sub("K", "", DAMAGE_PROPERTY, fixed = TRUE)))
```

Then let's start with something easy(ish) -- circles
```{r}
m <- leaflet(data = tornados) %>%
  addProviderTiles("Stamen.Toner") %>% 
  addCircles(~LONGITUDE, ~LATITUDE, 
             weight = 1, 
             radius = ~DAMAGE_PROPERTY*100, # Map the radius of the circle to amount of damage
             popup = ~EVENT_NARRATIVE)      # Include details about the tornado
m
```

## Polgyons come in shapefiles
Most boundaries (state, national, etc) are provided in terms of polygons. Major mapping software ArcGIS, from ESRI, has essentially set the standard formats. There are many files with different extensions: .prj (the projection), .shp (the shapefile), .cpg (??), .dbf (??), .shx (??). 

You need special software or packages to work with shapefiles. 

## State shapefiles
I got these from [the Census](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf_state.html). You can choose the resolution. 

If you want, the zipfile of the shapes I used is [here](https://jcrouser.github.io/MassMutual-DataVis/datasets/cb_2015_us_state_500k.zip). 

We're going to use the `maptools` package to deal with shapefiles.
```{r}
library(maptools)
library(rgdal)

states = readOGR("datasets/cb_2015_us_state_500k/cb_2015_us_state_500k.shp", verbose = TRUE)

# Convert strings to numbers
states$AWATER = as.numeric(states$AWATER)
states$ALAND = as.numeric(states$ALAND)
```

In RStudio, you can click on the `states` object to see what a `Large SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` looks like. It contains both `@data` and `@polygons`. 

## Exploring shapefiles

Let's start by mapping some boring, internal data from shapefile about the amount of water per state

```{r}
states %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  setView(-95.976807, 40.829587, zoom = 3) %>%
  addProviderTiles("Stamen.Toner") %>%
  addPolygons(stroke = FALSE, 
              fillOpacity = 0.5, 
              smoothFactor = 0.5, 
              color = ~colorQuantile("BrBG", states$AWATER)(AWATER)
  )
```

## Challenge

Put it all together! See if you can make a map of your own data, and embed it within a dashboard. **Bonus:** can you make them interact with one another?
