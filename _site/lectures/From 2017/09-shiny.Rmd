```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## manipulate package
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(manipulate)
library(ggplot2)
```

- only works in RStudio
- allows for interactive controls when coding

```{r, eval=FALSE}
manipulate(
  ggplot(data=diamonds, aes(x=carat)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=binselect),
binselect = slider(min=0.5,max=1,initial=0.7, step=0.01)
)
```

## Challenge:

Create a scatterplot of the relationship between `year` and `girls` in the arbuthnot data, with a loess smoother. 

Use manipulate to add a checkbox that turns the standard error visualization on and off. 

```{r}
arbuthnot <- read.csv("http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/arbuthnot.csv", header=T)
```

## Shiny

[Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) is an R package that allows you to program interactive web applications using R. 

[pre-Shiny quiz](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/quiz/) (warning: some of these are tricky!)


## Tutorial 
We'll be going through the [shiny tutorial from RStudio](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/lesson1/) 

## Challenge:
Create a shiny app that visualizes the same dataset three different ways. 

## Sharing shiny apps
  - Email the server.R and ui.R files to your colleagues
  - host on [shinyapps.io](http://www.shinyapps.io/)
  - Your own server, for example on [Digital Ocean](http://deanattali.com/2015/05/09/setup-rstudio-shiny-server-digital-ocean/)
  - [RStudio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/) (Enterprise-ready)


## Shiny dashboards

[Shiny dashboards](http://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/)

## Learning more about shiny

At the [2017 RStudio::conf](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/) there was a shiny/htmlwidgets track. All the talks are awesome! In particular: 

- Joe Cheng's [What's new with shiny](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/whats-new-with-shiny/)
- Barbara Borges Ribeiro's [dynamic shiny inferfaces](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/dynamic-shiny-interfaces/)

The [2016 Shiny Developer's Conferece](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/shiny-developer-conference/) went even deeper into Shiny. The videos are embedded in the site, so I can't direct-link them, but I recommend:

- Joe Cheng's talk on Effective Reactive Programming
- Jonathan McPherson on Debugging Techniques
- Winston Chang on Profiling and Performance
- Many of the user-submitted lightning talks are awesome, as well! In particular, check out Ricardo Bion on [Using Shiny to make decisions at scale for Airbnb](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/airbnb/). 


## HTMLwidgets

[HTMLwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/) are a way to connect any generic javascript library to R. 

They're useful because you don't need a server to make them work-- the javascript is on your local machine. So, they're lighter-weight than shiny apps. 

Some popular widgets: 

- [leaflet](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/showcase_leaflet.html)
- [plotly](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/showcase_plotly.html)

## Other cool stuff about HTMLwidgets

- [Crosstalk](http://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/): Almost-reactive behavior, dynamic subsetting. When MassMutual folks came to talk to students at Smith about d3, they were singing the praises of [Crossfilter](http://square.github.io/crossfilter/). Crosstalk is an R implementation of Crossfilter. It allows for dynamic brushing and linking. 
- [Flexdashboards](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) are a way to make non-Shiny dashboards that are lighter-weight. They don't have reactivity, unless it comes from a javascript library, but they don't need a server. 


## Making a map with points in R with leaflet
We're going to be doing a lot of the stuff from the RStudio [leaflet tutorial](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/).

```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval=FALSE)
```

```{r}
library(leaflet)
```

```{r}
m <- leaflet() %>%
  setView(-93.2650, 44.9778, zoom = 4) %>%
  addProviderTiles("Stamen.Toner") %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=-93.2650, lat=44.9778, popup="Minneapolis!")
m
```

Note that the syntax here is similar to that of `ggplot2`. Please consult the [Leaflet documentation](http://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) for more details.

## We need more data!!

Lets look at [storm data](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/ftp.jsp) from the NOAA. It comes in a few files that we need to join together in order to use. 

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

library(RCurl)

stormlocs <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmeliaMN/SummerDataViz/master/Geo/StormEvents_locations-ftp_v1.0_d2016_c20160810.csv")
stormlocs <- read_csv(stormlocs)
stormdetails <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmeliaMN/SummerDataViz/master/Geo/StormEvents_details-ftp_v1.0_d2016_c20160810.csv")
stormdetails <- read_csv(stormdetails)


#stormlocs <- read_csv("StormEvents_locations-ftp_v1.0_d2016_c20160810.csv")
#stormdetails <- read_csv("StormEvents_details-ftp_v1.0_d2016_c20160810.csv")
stormlocs <- stormlocs %>%
  left_join(stormdetails, by="EVENT_ID")
lightning <- stormlocs %>%
  filter(EVENT_TYPE=="Lightning")
```

## Mapping the lightning
Now, we can programmatically map them. 
```{r}
m <- leaflet(data=lightning) %>%
  addMarkers(~LONGITUDE, ~LATITUDE)

# OpenStreetMap
m %>%
  addTiles()
  
# Stamen
m %>% 
  addProviderTiles("Stamen.Toner") 

```

## Challenge: 
- Find another storm type to map
- Bonus-- add popups!

## One approach

```{r}
mtw <- stormlocs %>%
  filter(EVENT_TYPE=="Marine Thunderstorm Wind")

m <- leaflet(data=mtw) %>%
  addProviderTiles("Stamen.Toner") %>% 
  addMarkers(~LONGITUDE, ~LATITUDE, popup=~EVENT_NARRATIVE)

m
```


## Polygons

## Lets start with something easy(ish) -- circles

```{r}
tornados <- stormlocs %>%
  filter(EVENT_TYPE=="Tornado")
```

```{r}
m <- leaflet(data=tornados) %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addCircles(~LONGITUDE, ~LATITUDE, weight = 1, radius = ~DAMAGE_PROPERTY*100, popup = ~EVENT_NARRATIVE)
m
```

## Polgyons come in shapefiles
Most boundaries (state, national, etc) are provided in terms of polygons. Major mapping software ArcGIS, from ESRI, has essentially set the standard formats. 

Look in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/AmeliaMN/SummerDataViz/tree/master/Geo/cb_2015_us_state_500k) to see some examples of how this looks. There are many files with different extensions: .prj (the projection), .shp (the shapefile), .cpg (??), .dbf (??), .shx (??). 

You need special software or packages to work with shapefiles. 

## State shapefiles
I got these from [the Census](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf_state.html). You can choose the resolution. 

If you want, the zipfile of the shapes I used is [here](https://github.com/AmeliaMN/SummerDataViz/blob/master/Geo/cb_2015_us_state_500k.zip). 

We're going to use the `rgdal` package to deal with shapefiles. Better would be the `sp` package, but I haven't gotten there yet. 

```{r}
library(rgdal)

# In the Console, I need to use a different path

states <- readOGR("cb_2015_us_state_500k", layer = "cb_2015_us_state_500k", verbose = FALSE)
```

In RStudio, you can click on the `states` object to see what a Large SpatialPolygonsDataFrame looks like. `@data` and `@polygons`. 

## Boring, internal data from shapefile

```{r}
leaflet(data=states) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolygons(stroke = FALSE, fillOpacity = 0.5, smoothFactor = 0.5, color =~colorQuantile("YlOrRd", states$AWATER)(AWATER)
  )
```


## Something more interesting -- need to count up some data
```{r}
tornadocount <- tornados %>%
  group_by(STATE) %>%
  summarize(n=n())
```


## Colors are tricky!

[colorbrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3)

```{r}
colors <- c("#edf8fb", "#b2e2e2", "#66c2a4", "#238b45")
tornadocount <- tornadocount %>%
  mutate(color = cut(n, breaks=quantile(n)))

# Baaaaad factor practice. Do as I say, not as I do?!
levels(tornadocount$color) <- colors
```


## Joining data
```{r}
states@data$NAME <- toupper(states@data$NAME)
states@data <- left_join(states@data, tornadocount, by=c("NAME"="STATE"))
```


## Putting it all together
```{r}
leaflet(data=states) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolygons(stroke = FALSE, fillOpacity = 0.5, smoothFactor = 0.5, color = ~states@data$color.y)
```
